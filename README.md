# Inteo to Me
Hello! I am GamingZacharyC, a programmer-by-hobby that mostly focuses on Minecraft modding. In my spare time, I play plenty of video games, watch all too much YouTube, and make not-useless open-source code projects.

Some random stuff about me:
* *Correct my mistakes! Inform me of better ways!* ***I'm only here to learn.*** Please, by all means, correct me.
* I am a huge supporter and advocate for Dark Mode. I urge you to check out [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader)!
* Windows is my perfered platform because of the developer friendliness.
* [Logitech G](https://logitechg.com/) for the win!
* Giving tech support is oddly satisfying to me.
* I'm somewhat a security freak. SECURE IT ALL. 2FA for EVERYONE!
* I love to manage Discord servers, weirdly.

# Current Projects
* Aetherium ([GamingZacharyC\Aetherium](https://github.com/GamingZacharyC/Aetherium)), my current large project, is a mod for Minecraft inspired by Thaumcraft (but quite a bit different, not a copy of [Arcana]()) with a release *nowhere near*. See [the Aetherium website](https://gamingzacharyc.github.io/Aetherium). To download any stable development builds, look no further than GitHub Releases. As for unofficial, in-dev builds, [compile the code yourself](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/#building-and-testing-your-mod:~:text=To%20build%20your%20mod%2C%20run%20gradlew,the%20Minecraft%20server%20with%20its%20GUI.).
