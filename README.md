# Inteo to Me
Hello! I am GamingZacharyC, a programmer that mostly focuses on Minecraft modding. In my spare time, I play plenty of video games, watch all too much YouTube, and make open-source code projects.

## Just some random facts
My current project is Aetherium (GamingZacharyC\Aetherium), a mod for Minecraft that will be fully released _at least_ sometime during the 1.18 update cycle (i.e. late in 1.17's lifetime). This is not a release date, and I expect to go over this by a long shot. I expect a beta out *before* 1.17 drops, but the full release of the mod will likely be much further away than 1.18. You have been warned.

If you want a description of what Aetherium is, take a look at [the Aetherium website](gamingzacharyc.github.io/Aetherium). To download any available Aetherium betas/alphas, please view [the CurseForge page], or, for development builds, compile the code yourself.


To compile Minecraft mods yourself:

* download the code
* run the correct command:
** Windows
*** cd Drive:\Path\To\Downloaded\Code
*** gradlew runClient
** Windows (Combined)
***cd Drive:\Path\To\Downloaded\Code && gradlew runClient
